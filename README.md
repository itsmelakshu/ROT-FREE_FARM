# ROT-FREE_FARM
I recently developed an app called ROT-FREE FARM. This app helps farmers detect whether their fruits are fresh or rotten. The app can also be used by customers at local supermarkets. It is very helpful for communities as farming has a huge impact on our world and farmers face a lot of challenges. ROT-FREE FARM. will not only help farmers be more productive but will also make their work more efficient. This is the code for my app!
